# MarvelCharacters
Shows Marvel characters and their description

Used stack:
- Kotlin
- MVP
- Retrofit
- Coil
- application "survives" screen rotation

To run the application, you need to get the keys https://developer.marvel.com/ 
and register them in RetrofitItemsRepositoryImplementation.kt
In this application, the keys are hidden using BuildConfig or add a file (keys.properties) with keys to the project

I plan to add a second screen by clicking on the character
